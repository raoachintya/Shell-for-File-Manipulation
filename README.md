# Shell-for-File-Manipulation
A repository for a basic idea on how to manipulate files and folders.

This has final.sh file that runs all the other shells in a sequential manner.
1. This creates a directory that has no files initially.
2. Hundred files are generated which have the date as teh content.
3. It then creates a file that has the concatenation of all the files.
4. We then add the file name as prefix and then save it into a new file.
5. We also have shell that reverse and sorts the data in one new file.
6. We also check the difference in the two text files which are obtained after conversion.

To Run:

1. Just run the command ./final.sh
